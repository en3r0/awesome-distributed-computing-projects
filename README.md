## Hosting
 A decentralization of hostings(GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc) using BitTorrent and Bitcoin
- [cjb/GitTorrent](https://github.com/cjb/GitTorrent): A decentralization of GitHub using BitTorrent and Bitcoin

## Search engine
Distributed search engines using BitTorrent and SQLite or any database
- [lmatteis/torrent-net](https://github.com/lmatteis/torrent-net): Distributed search engines using BitTorrent and SQLite

## Trackers
A BitTorrent tracker is a special type of server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol.
- [legittorrents.info](https://github.com/en3r0/legittorrents.info): I started Legit Torrents in the Fall of 2005. I was still in high school and back then there was no 100% legal torrent tracker that anyone could easily submit to. There was legaltorrents.com, but if memory serves me correctly, it was more of a curated thing.

## Deploy
Large scale server deploys using BitTorrent and the BitTornado library
- [lg/murder](https://github.com/lg/murder): Large scale server deploys using BitTorrent and the BitTornado library (NOTE: project no longer maintained)
- [russss/Herd](https://github.com/russss/Herd): A single-command bittorrent distribution system, based on Twitter's Murder
