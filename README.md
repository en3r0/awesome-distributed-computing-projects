# Awesome distributed computing projects [![certified awesome!](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of amazingly awesome open source distributed resources. There are a number of good reasons to avoid centralized networks or consider something other than centralized networks:
- Bandwidth, Backup, CPU / GPU Intensive, Data dump
- Databases, Storage, Search engines, Censorship-resistant communication and publishing
- Digital Currency, "Mining", Mining node searches for currency
- Uses idle time, Large scale server deploys, Disk Intensive
- Many different projects, one appplication
- Synchronize the clocks of computers over a network

## Distributed computing projects

* [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/): Anonymous overlay network.
* [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/): Routes traffic between nodes to hide identy. An exit node can put you at risk, but you run a relay node only.
* [ZeroNet](https://zeronet.io/): Peer-to-peer websites.

***Digital Currency***

## üìö Notes
**Data_dump:** A data dump refers to the process of extracting and copying a large amount of data from one system or database to another, typically for backup, analysis, or migration purposes.

**Patch:** Patches are software and operating system (OS) updates that address security vulnerabilities within a program or product. Software vendors may choose to release updates to fix performance bugs, as well as to provide enhanced security features.

**Torrent:** Torrenting is the act of downloading and uploading files through the BitTorrent network. Instead of downloading files to a central server, torrenting involves downloading files from other users' devices on the network. Conversely, users upload files from their own devices for other users to download

**Demo:** A demo is what you give to show how something works. You might give a demo of your fancy new espresso machine to your weekend guests, so they'll know how to use it. Demo is short for demonstrate or demonstration.

**Datasets:** Dataset is a collection of various types of data stored in a digital format. Data is the key component of any Machine Learning project. Datasets primarily consist of images, texts, audio, videos, numerical data points, etc., for solving various Artificial Intelligence challenges such as. Image or video classification.

**Media:** The main means of mass communication (broadcasting, publishing, and the internet) regarded collectively.

**Iso:** International Organization for Standardization(ISO), ISO images contain the binary image of an optical media file system (usually ISO 9660 and its extensions or UDF), including the data in its files in binary ...

**Mods:** Mod is an abbreviation used for the modulo operation, used in computer programming, Video game modding (short for "modification") is the process of alteration by players or fans of one or more aspects of a video game.

**Indexers:** Websites to trackers torrent as isos, media-files etc.

**Trackers:** A BitTorrent tracker is a special type of server that assists in the communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol.
